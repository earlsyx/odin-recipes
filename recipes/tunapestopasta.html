    <h2>Tuna Pesto Pasta</h2>
    <p>Tuna pesto pasta is a delicious twist on the classic Italian pesto 
        pasta recipe that makes ingredients more accessible while adding more healthy, 
        lean tuna for protein for a more filling, complete meal. This recipe easily 
        upgrades the basic recipe as the herby freshness of the basil 
        sauce perfectly complements the strong distinct flavor of tuna.</p>

    <p>This dish, as with all pesto dishes, is inspired by Pesto Genovese which
         traditionally uses fresh Italian basil leaves, DOP pecorino cheese, 
         DOP parmesan cheese, pine nuts, olive oil, garlic and salt all blended
          strenuously together with a marble mortar and pestle.
           (DOP stands for Denominazione d’ Origine Protetta, which is Italian for 
           Protected Destination of Origin. It simply means these cheeses are authentically
            made in Italy). The process of crushing it together to paste-like consistency 
            with a “pestle” is what gives this dish its name.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>3 cloves Garlic peeled</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup grated parmesan cheese more for garnish</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons roasted cashew nuts or toasted pine nuts</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 180-gram cans tuna in oil</li>
        <li>1 500-gram pack spaghetti cooked according to package directions</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground pepper to taste</li>

    <h4>Steps in creating the dish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor or blender, combine all the ingredients for the 
                homemade pesto: basil, garlic, nuts, cheese, and olive oil. 
                Process until finely chopped. Season with salt and pepper, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a small pan, mix the tuna with oil and the freshly made basil pesto. Turn 
                off the heat. Toss the mixture in the freshly cooked pasta.
                 Transfer to a bowl, and garnish with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
