    <h2>Instant Noodles Tantanmen Style</h2>
    <p>Before, it was the Chinese chicken mami that made chilly rainy days bearable. With its combination of noodles, shredded chicken, 
        and the occasional cubed vegetable swimming in the flavorful chicken broth, sipping and slurping was the thing to do when eating these 
        noodle soups.  </p>

    <p>Ask anyone now and you’ll discover that Japanese-style ramen has taken over as the favorite hot bowl of noodle soups. 
        The Japanese ramen is richer than the Chinese style of noodle soups, where bones are simmered for hours
         to create a collagen-rich liquid that coats each noodle and ingredient component in the bowl. </p>
    <p>Asian noodles soups have a tendency to share histories and the Japanese tantanmen ramen and Chinese dan 
        dan noodles may indeed be just that: twin recipes adapted to suit the country it is enjoyed. </p>
    <p>Both noodle dishes are peanutty, both are loaded with ground meat, and both can also be made spicy, especially
         if you add the favored spicy condiment of choice of either country: the Chinese spicy chili oil or Japanese red pepper powder. </p>
    <p>What these two noodle bowls also share is a long cooking process. This can easily be hacked if you use instant noodle packs. 
        That’s what we do in this tantanmen noodle hack. </p>
