    <h2>Jollibee Jolly Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>This has to be one of your childhood favorites! The Jolly Spaghetti from Jollibee is just as delicious and nostalgic as the crispy fried chicken,
         and we’re not surprised: the dish has everything we want in an indulgent kiddie spaghetti recipe.</p>

    <p>What is amazing is that it’s not just for kids. Not everyone loves spaghetti but it’s undoubtedly the spaghetti the kid inside of us will love.</p>
    <p>If you want to relive a childhood memory or two with a Jollibee-inspired spaghetti at home, we have good news for you: Francis Lim of Tipple 
        and Slaw and Nav came up with a recipe close to that same spaghetti that you can replicate at home.</p>
    <p>The result of his many recipe tests and trials is the recipe you will find below. You might be surprised to see a couple of ingredients in there,
         but they’re what Chef Francis discovered to be necessary for creating the iconic sauce that has captivated many kids — and kids at heart — for
          generations.</p>
    <p>Such ingredients include liver spread and banana ketchup which aren’t exactly new to any spaghetti. But condensed milk? We, too, were surprised. So here it is. 
        We don’t want you to stop patronizing the happy bee just yet, but here’s a chance for you to enjoy the spaghetti any time and anywhere.</p>
